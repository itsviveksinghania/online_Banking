# Project Description:

The objective of this project is to create a Bank Management application that allows the admin to manage customer accounts, deposit and withdraw balance from customer accounts, and transfer funds between accounts. The application will be developed using JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL as the database management system.

The application will have an authentication system that allows the admin to log in using a username and password. Once logged in, the admin will be able to add new customers to the system and create deposit accounts for them. The customer information will be stored in the database, and each customer will be assigned a unique account number.

The application will allow the admin to deposit and withdraw funds from the customer's account. The admin will be able to view the customer's account balance and transaction history. The transaction history will include details such as the date, transaction type, and the amount.

The application will also have a feature that allows the admin to transfer funds from one customer account to another. The admin will need to enter the account numbers of the sender and the receiver, along with the transfer amount. The application will validate the transaction and update the account balances accordingly.

The database will be normalized to ensure data consistency and avoid data redundancy. The database schema will include tables for customers, accounts, transactions, and user authentication.

The GUI will be developed using JavaFX, which is a user interface toolkit for creating desktop applications. The application will have a clean and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for the admin to manage customer accounts and transactions.

In summary, this project will create a Bank Management application using JavaFX for the GUI and MySQL as the database management system. The application will allow the admin to manage customer accounts, deposit and withdraw balance from customer accounts, and transfer funds between accounts. The application will be secure and easy to use, with a clean and intuitive user interface.
